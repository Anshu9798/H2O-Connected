        <p><strong>In 2019, a new company was born...</strong></p>
        <p>Founded by Susan Springsteen and located in the Qualified Opportunity Zone of Coatesville, PA, H20 Connected, LLC has engaged in both expanding and improving the LeakAlertorÂ® product line, as well as creating a presence within the Coatesville community. Originally a part of parent company nth Solutions, the LeakAlertor products and technologies now sell under their own independent brand and company. H20 Connected has demonstrated its dedication to preserving water and detecting leaks in toilets through its launch of the LeakAlertor 6000 and in the future, the wireless LeakAlertor Pro. In addition to its development of commercial products, H20 Connected is also in the process of renovating a historic building into what will soon be its new office and manufacturing facility. </p>

        <p><strong>Where it all started...</strong></p>
        <p>Before H20 Connected, the LeakAlertor products were developed by nth Solutions, a vertically integrated product development & manufacturing company whose design team holds more than 50 commercialized patents. Founded by Eric Canfield and Susan Springsteen in 2006, the company has lived by its mission to <i>Save Money, Save Lives, and Preserve Natural Resources</i> for over a decade. Currently based in Exton, Pennsylvania, nth Solutions involves a whole team of interns, marketers, and engineers to develop and expand intellectual property for commercialization, distribution, and sales. The company continues today to develop a wide range of unique products for homes and businesses!</p>
